		<h1>A short biography</h1>
		<p>My name is Jennifer Diederich, but my friends call me Jen. I am a single mother of 2 boys, ages 12 and 18. I have been self-employed 
		for over 12 years as a DISH and DIRECTV retailer, which at one time included being an ALLTEL and a Verizon Wireless 
		retailer. When I started with DISH over 17 years ago, I never meant for it to be my life long career. I have always 
		wanted to continue my education, so when my life took an unexpected turn, I found I had the opportunity to do 
		something new and go to school.</p>
		
		<p>My field of choice is the IT-Software Developer program. I have always enjoyed learning new 
		software programs and found I have a knack for finding errors in them. I am constantly
		thinking of what I would change or do differently to improve upon them which is especially true  
		in the satellite programs that I have used. I plan on graduating with my Associates Degree to
		start working in my new field and will continue my education in hopes to eventually gain my 
		Masters Degree.</p>
